# pentocity
Solving the Pentocity problem for COMS 4444.

## Collaborating on GitHub
Each of us can push our own code to our own branches (e.g. Stephanie would push to a 'stephanie' branch) and then create pull
requests to merge into master.

## Todo
* [x] If rejection due to road can't be connected, do something else
* [x] Complete the remaining edge, one loop before and one loop after the three loops
* [x] Discuss more hueristics for this problem
* [ ] Explore water / fields
* [ ] Abstract Buildings to Plots, these plots can be predefined
* [ ] Explore how Buildings can be fitted together well

## Commands
    javac pentos/sim/Simulator.java
    javac pentos/g5/Player.java
    java pentos.sim.Simulator -g g5 --gui
    git archive master g5/ --format=zip --output g5.zip

## Utilities
* BuildingUtil has all the code relevant to Buildings in it
* LandUtil has all the code relevant to Land in it
* Pentominos is a simple sequencer to generate [all the pentomino shapes](pentos/docs/pentominos.txt)

    javac pentos/g5/util/Pentominos.java
    java pentos.g5.util.Pentominos

* It also has functions to pack two buildings together to generate few [efficient packing schemes](pentos/docs/pentominos-packing.txt)
  - Tested packing of buildings with a variety of objective functions
  - HullSize -- Total size of convex hull produced after putting together two buildings
  - RoadSide -- Number of road pieces covered together by the group
  - HullFactor -- Ratio of packed hull to sum of independent hulls
  - Shortlisted a few candidates where HullFactor < 1.0
